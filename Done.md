## Coursera

### [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns)(2021.11-2021.12)

**Personal view**: Course is ordinary, just some bases about design patterns. I am not quite satisfied with the grading of the homework. But if you just want to know a little about this subject, it will be suitable for you.
